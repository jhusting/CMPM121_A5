Hello! This project uses some code I made with assignment 3.

Here are the controls:

Move: Left Stick OR WASD
Turn Left/Right: Right Stick OR Q/E
Attack: (Hold and Release): RB OR Space
Turn on/off light: Joystick A or F (Keyboard)

Assets Used:
Warrior Pack Bundle 2 FREE https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/warrior-pack-bundle-2-free-42454
Greek Low Poly Pack - Lite https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/historic/greek-low-poly-pack-lite-136606
Free Mummy Monster - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/free-mummy-monster-134212

Summary:
In this game you are an archer character (models and animations I found on the asset store). 
You can hold the right bumper/space to fire an arrow, which will destroy the mummies after 3 hits.

The mummies will not follow you unless you are looking at them (your view angle is 70 degrees, roughly the size of the light)
But watch out! If you attack them once they'll know that you've found them out and will start attacking.

There are also doors that will block your progress unless you pick up the glowing cubes and appease the :100: gods!
